This project is part of the Data Science Nano-Degree from Udacity.
The purpose of this project is to showcase an example of a recommender engine that utilizes different approaches (e.g. Knowledge Based, Content Based, and Collaborative Filtering Based) for recommendations.

The approach utilized in the Collaborative Filtering approach here uses the Singular Value Decomposition approach on simplified user-item interaction data.
